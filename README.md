# Ludum Dare 49

**Note:** this game was made in 72 hours by a team of 3 people for [Ludum Dare 49](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/49/alteration).

We are proud to present you Alteration after just 72 hours of blood, sweat and pixels.

You are playing as your astral projection, which is thrown into a surreal maze, and your goal is to reach perfect balance, symbolized by the goal of each level.
But beware! As your mind is yet unbalanced, your mood will change your form every couple of turns.
Depending on your state, your element and therefore your interactions with the world will change.
Learn the special abilities and master your astral projection to reach the end of all 16 levels.
