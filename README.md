Alteration is a game made in just 72 hours of blood, sweat and pixels. (*edit: this branch is the postjam version, containing a few [more features and polish](https://colinbellino.itch.io/alteration/devlog/346812/alteration-200-post-jam-version).*)

You are playing as your astral projection, which is thrown into a surreal maze and your goal is to reach perfect balance, symbolized by the goal of each level.
But beware as your mind is yet unbalanced your mood will change your form every couple of turns.

Depending on your state your element and therefore interactions with the world will change.
Learn the special abilities and master your astral projection to reach the end of all 16 levels.
